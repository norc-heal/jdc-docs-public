Improved access to high-quality, evidence-based addiction treatment in justice settings will be critical to addressing the opioid crisis. As part of the NIH HEAL Initiative, JCOIN studies approaches to increase high-quality care for people with opioid misuse and OUD in justice settings. JCOIN will test strategies to expand effective treatment and care in partnership with local and state justice systems and community-based treatment providers. For more general information on JCOIN visit the NIH JCOIN website About the JCOIN Data commons ## The JCOIN Data Commons supports cross-site data synchronization and reporting in addition to analytic tools to support JCOIN research goals. JCOIN Data Commons (JDC) is a system built on the Gen3 software platform developed by the Center for Translational Data Science (CTDS) at the University of Chicago. A Gen3 Data Commons provides a secure platform for sharing and computing over data, and may be accessed through this website or via the application programming interface (API).

Given the critical importance of public opinion towards policy making and approaches used in the justice system, this project will measure public support for OUD treatment in the general public, assess stigma associated with OUD, and perceptions of criminality around OUD.
